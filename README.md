<h2>Hi there, my name is Jaiden ðŸ‘‹</h2>

I'm currently a student at the University of British Columbia studying Biomedical Engineering and Computer Science. Passionate about architecting and developing software, my mission is to bring applications and services to fruition. In my free time, you'll find me breaking a sweat at the gym, conquering new heights at the climbing gym, and bringing my engineering projects to life.
